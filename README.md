# TodoTracker

-- BUGS --------

-) 'ToDo' / 'Done tasks' -labels show up when there's just 1 task in either, and e.g. 'Done tasks' should only show if >=1 done tasks exist in current date

-) 


-- FEATURES --------
-) Fetch unfinished tasks <Button>
  A button to bring unfinished tasks from previous days, up to today would be nice.
  
-) Edit existing tasks
  To be able to edit existing tasks would be useful in case of typos etc.
  
-) Return to current date
  In case i swapped a lot of pages around, and forgot (or got far away) from the current date, i'd like to be able to click a 'return' button or similar to with one click go back to today.
  
-) Calendar view
  I'd like to be able to pop open a small calender (browse months etc) with the following options:
  A) See a colored view (e.g. gray / white) if each day has unfinished tasks in them
  B) Click a day in the month to go to that day
  C) Browse between months
